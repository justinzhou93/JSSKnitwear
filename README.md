# JSS Knitwear

This is an E-commerce site built for JSS Knitwear. I used React and Redux for the front end and for the back end, I built an Express server with a PostgreSQL database to receive requests with RESTful API.

## URL

https://jssknitwear.herokuapp.com/

Note: it is running on heroku server as a free project (just for the moment, until JSS compiles proper data for use), so it might take upwards of 10 seconds to load up, since heroku takes down sites that aren't regularly used.

## Built With

* [Express.js](https://github.com/expressjs/express) - JS server side web framework
* [React.js](https://github.com/facebook/react) - JS UI library
* [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) - State container, not specifically meant for React.js, but largely used in tandem with React.js to contain current state of the application
